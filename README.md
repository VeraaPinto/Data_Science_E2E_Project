# ðŸ“ˆ Data Science E2E Project:Forecast predictive model to enhance MAPE performance

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to enhance forecast accuracy and optimize MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) performance for product sales across multiple regions. The analysis integrates sales, forecast, stock levels, and metadata to deliver actionable insights and recommendations for business planning and inventory management.

## Dataset

**Sources:**  
- Forecast.csv: Sales, forecasts, MAPE, errors  
- Stocks.csv: Stock levels and coverage  
- Countries_Geo.csv: Country metadata and segmentation  
- MD.csv: Product and market metadata

**Typical Columns:**  
Date, Product Family, GMID, Location, Country, Sales, Forecast, MAPE, Absolute Error, Stock Coverage, Market, Geography, Material Type

**Enrichment:**  
- Geographic segmentation  
- Product and market categories  
- Error attribution and impact analysis

## Objectives

- Explore relationships between product, region, and forecast error (MAPE)
- Engineer features for enhanced interpretability (e.g., region, product family, error categorization)
- Train, optimize, and compare multiple regression models for forecasting
- Use model predictions to provide recommendations for improving forecast accuracy and business outcomes

## Project Workflow

### Data Preparation & Exploration

- Imported libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost, lightgbm
- Loaded and examined datasets for structure, missing values, and outliers
- Summarized dataset statistics (describe(), datatypes, shape)

### Feature Engineering

- Standardized date formats and key columns across datasets
- Merged sales/forecast data with geographic and product metadata
- Generated error impact and contribution features
- Encoded categorical features for modeling
- Resolved duplicate records in stock data, prioritized by data completeness

### Data Visualization & EDA

- Bar plots: error distribution across regions, products, and time
- Boxplots: detect outliers in sales, forecast, errors
- Scatterplots: examine relationships between forecast, sales, and error metrics
- Correlation heatmaps: identify key associations
- Grouped analyses: mean/median error by region, product family

### Model Training & Evaluation

- Preprocessing: scaling, train-test split
- Regression Models:
    - Linear Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Gradient Boosting Regressor
    - XGBoost / LightGBM
- Evaluation Metrics:
    - RÂ² (coefficient of determination)
    - MAE (mean absolute error)
    - RMSE (root mean squared error)
- Results: Compared model performance on train/test sets and visualized via barplots

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Used RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters (e.g., tree depth, estimators)
- Performance improved significantly after tuning

### Advanced Analysis

- Integrated product and geographic segmentation into feature set
- Analyzed error contribution and impact at regional and product levels
- Provided scenario-based recommendations for improving forecast accuracy

## Results

- Best Model: Tuned ensemble regressor (AdaBoost, Bagging Regressor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Key Features: Geographic region, product family, historical sales, forecast error metrics
- Actionable Insight:
    - Targeted adjustment of forecasts by region and product can significantly reduce MAPE and improve inventory planning
    - Data-driven recommendations for model-driven business strategy
